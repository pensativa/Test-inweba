# Testing landing page

This test task is to check the basic skills of creating websites. It was necessary to reproduce the layout using code as accurately as possible. It was important to pay special attention to the correspondence of fonts, colors, element sizes and the overall appearance.

I created this project completely from scratch without using third-party libraries or other ready-made solutions. Most of all, I liked working on interactive elements and coming up with micro animations.
